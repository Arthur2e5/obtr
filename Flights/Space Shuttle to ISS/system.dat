1 NOTE Welcome! You are in command of Space Shuttle Atlantis to fly a resupply mission to the International Space Station.
11 NOTE Atlantis is ready on pad 39C of Kennedy Space Center. T-100 and counting.
21 NOTE This flight is pre-recorded, but I will explain the procedures and the use of the autopilot, so you can fly your own mission later.
31 NOTE (If the left MFD display is not visible, then the console MFD module is not active. This doesn't affect the replay, but if you want to follow the autopilot instructions, exit the simulation now, activate the 'LuaMFD' module, and restart).

3020 NOTE We are approaching apoapsis. This will be our designated rendezvous point with the ISS.
3035 NOTE The ISS is currently trailing us by about 20°. In order to let it catch up, we need to increase our orbit period by increasing the orbit semi-major axis.
3050 NOTE We will do this by performing a prograde burn now to raise periapsis (soon to become apoapsis).
3065 NOTE The delta-V budget of the Shuttle's OMS tanks is very limited (and we need to keep enough fuel for rendezvous and deorbiting).
3080 NOTE Therefore we can change our orbit parameters only by a small amount. This means that it will take the ISS several orbits to catch up.
3095 NOTE The burn will be timed so that we will intercept the ISS in about 7 orbits.

3351 NOTE The projected rendezvous will take place at your 6th (the ISS' 7th) crossing of the rendezvous point, in a bit over 10 hours.

3381 NOTE At the next apoapsis passage, we will need to fine-tune the periapsis altitude to coincide with the ISS altitude at rendezvous point.
3396 NOTE For this, note the ISS altitude as soon as it passes your periapsis point. It should be about 369km, so we need to raise periapsis to this altitude.

8865 NOTEPOS 0.65 0.2 0.96 0.9
8865 NOTE Next, let's have a look at the periapsis altitude. Remember, we performed an apoapsis burn half an orbit ago, to raise periapsis to the target altitude of 369km.
8880 NOTE But you can now see that the actual periapsis altitude is about 9km lower, at 360.4km. What is going on?
8895 NOTE The Orbit MFD displays the elements of an unperturbed 2-body orbit that corresponds to the vessel's current state vectors (position and velocity).
8910 NOTE However, the state vectors are perturbed along the trajectory due to various effects, such as the nonspherical shape of Earth. The result is a continuous change of the corresponding momentary orbital elements (osculating elements).
8925 NOTE In this particular case, the osculating elements at apoapsis and periapsis predict different periapsis altitudes. So what can we do?
8940 NOTE It is fairly straightforward to perform a 0-th order correction. We assume that small changes in periapsis altitude are consistent between periapsis and apoapsis, even if the absolute altitudes are not.
8955 NOTE Therefore, we will raise the apoapsis altitude by another 9km at the next apoapsis passage (independent of the absolute indicated value).

11650 NOTE Periapsis altitude is predicted at about 368km. We want to raise this by 9km, so need to aim for 377km. This should give us a true periapsis altitude of about 369km.
11665 NOTE Engaging OMS engines for prograde burn.

16735 NOTE First, orbital plane alignment. We are approaching the node with the ISS plane of orbit, so this is a good opportunity to cancel out any residual inclination that might have built up.
